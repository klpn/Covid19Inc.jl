# Covid19Inc.jl

There seems to be some interesting interactions between age and sex
for various outcomes related to COVID-19 infection, e.g. the
ratio between male and female incidence in (confirmed) infection
may increase with age. At the same time, available data which break
down the number of cases on both sex and age are still relatively
sparse.

This repository collects age- and sex-specific data on COVID-19
infection from various locations around the world in CSV files
in the [`data`](https://github.com/klpn/Covid19Inc.jl/blob/master/data) directory.
The files are named according to the scheme `[WPP location]_covid19_[date].csv`,
e.g. [data/380_covid19_2020-03-26.csv](https://github.com/klpn/Covid19Inc.jl/blob/master/data/380_covid19_2020-03-26.csv)
contains data for Italy (WPP location 380) up to 2020-03-26.
Sources for the data are given in the
BibTeX file [`data/sources.bib`](https://github.com/klpn/Covid19Inc.jl/blob/master/data/sources.bib).

The repository also provides a Julia module for plotting incidence by
age and sex, using the [PGFPlotsX.jl](https://github.com/KristofferC/PGFPlotsX.jl)
package. In order to provide
estimates of population at risk, the module uses World Population
Prospects for 2019. You can download the 
[WPP 2019 CSV file](https://population.un.org/wpp/Download/Files/1_Indicators%20(Standard)/CSV_FILES/WPP2019_PopulationByAgeSex_Medium.csv) in the `data` directory.

In order to plot incidence for Spain, with
10-year age group up to 90â€“ years, run from Julia.

```julia
include("src/Covid19Inc.jl")
Covid19Inc.covid_pop(724, :i10o90, "2020-03-30") |> Covid19Inc.covidpl
```
